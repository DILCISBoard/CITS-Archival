## E-ARK Common Specification for Archival Information

When the digital information is transferred, it needs to be accompanied in most cases by archival information giving the order of the material, and information about the creator. This specification endorses the use of currently available profiles using the formats; EAD, EAD2002, EAD3, EAC-CPF, EAG and RiC. The use of the Archives Portal Europe Profiles is specifically encouraged because they allow information to be transferred to the portal and Europeana thereby making digital objects available globally.
